# **PCO Filtration Addon: A Sun-Inspired Solution for Cleaner Air**

PCO Filtration ingeniously mirrors what the sun accomplishes with VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) in our atmosphere. Under natural conditions, UV rays from the sun interact with VOCs and, with the help of other elements in the air, break them down into "harmless" CO<sub>2</sub>. What if we could harness this process in our filtration systems?

**UVC** lights, set at a non-ozone-producing safe wavelength of 275nm, energize a **TiO<sub>2</sub>** (titanium dioxide) mesh, triggering electron conformation changes. Water molecules passing by react with the energized mesh, producing **hydroxyl radicals** and other reactive species that **"attack" VOCs**, effectively chopping them into smaller pieces. 

While simple VOCs can be broken down to the smallest unit of CO<sub>2</sub> rapidly, larger and more complex VOCs might necessitate multiple passes and hydroxyl radical "chops". Over time, the photocatalytic filter addon progressively degrades the contaminants. 

# Utility Across Various Fronts:
**Enhanced Efficiency:** 

VOCs that resist carbon capture may transform into a different type of VOC that is more readily trapped by filtration media, thereby enhancing the combined efficiency. Although photocatalytic filtration is generally slower than swift HEPA or carbon capture, it plays a crucial role.

**Persistent Cleanliness**: 

The PCO addon can operate even between prints to counteract styrene residue from surface off-gassing, or even from the carbon filtration media itself as the carbon ages, ensuring cleaner air for extended periods.

**Adaptability to Heat**: 

As the chamber’s temperature rises, the efficiency of carbon diminishes. Approximately at 60°C, carbon filtration becomes suboptimal. Conversely, photocatalytic reactivity benefits from the heat energy in the air, positioning the PCO addon as an excellent strategy to conserve carbon by allowing it to cool off while utilizing the heat to eliminate VOCs photocatalytically!

*<sup>1</sup>*  2.5W likely enough, but a stronger light will make a stronger reaction and give margin for UV degradation (80% strength left after 1000hrs seems pretty standard), but its unknown if the added heat creates a problem.<br>
*<sup>2</sup>*  3mm mesh cut with scissors to two pieces of approximately 128x40mm. A single 500x500mm sheet will thus be enough for _alot_ of TiO<sub>2</sub> filters<br>
*<sup>3</sup>*  Two of these slots are made for SHCS bolts if you've got them, but BHCS will fit just as well<br>
