# **Stealthmax [S]**

Lets decrease size a bit shall we, in order to print the Stealthmax on machines with a 250mm bed? 

**StealthMax [S]** is what we end up with - reworked from the ground up, its both 20% [**S**]maller than a regular Stealthmax, as well as much more [**S**]ilent due to the smaller, lower noise fan. See BOM below (purchase links linked on the main page).

- The 65mm GPU Fan has been swapped for a [**60mm Delta KFB0612HAFDB**](https://www.onetwo3d.co.uk/product/delta-kfb0612hafdb-fan/) It has less air flow at 9.15cfm unrestricted, but on the other hand is much less noisy. The unrestrictive nature of a stealthmax circular basket also allows for much more usable airflow from this fan compared to a smaller filter design.
- The panel has shrunken to **200mm @ 3mm** thickness.
- Mounting points for VOC sensors has changed compared to the regular stealthmax.
- **Hepa filters** have been changed to smaller [**Xiaomi Mijia 1C circular HEPA filters**](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EwnZuLl), which means the total carbon depth (equaling efficiency) of the filter has not decreased more than a bit over one centimeter compared to the original Stealthmax.
- Most everything else remains the same from the regular BOM, including sensors, pico, buck converter, with just a few minor bolt changes: Exact fastener list as per the CAD file available above is (feel free to use the affiliate links from the main stealth max page for any purchases!):
